Deployment issue
when tried with and without nginx same type of issue occured
- with nginx: "502 Bad-gateaway"
- without nginx: "This site canâ€™t be reachedec2-3-82-117-72.compute-1.amazonaws.com refused to connect".
tried:
- check server logs: server logs generation on AWS CLI is inactive and on putty "fatal error"(inactive) at the moment of this error
- tensorflow log: "10% memory exceeds". This issue gone after increasing instance size (c3.large to c5.2xlarge).
- check nginx error.log: "faild when connecting to upstream"
- run local system for a long duration as in aws to check whether getting this issue; Woks fine (put it on run morethan 2 hours)

Wanna to check:
- logs during ml model running (local host); let try to check on localsystem
